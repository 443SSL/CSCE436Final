## Motivation Statement
The STEM field is a highly gendered space. In this new age of inclusivity, diversity should be highly encouraged in order to bring people together from different creeds and backgrounds to enrich the workplace and work achieved. 

The first step to modifying gender norms in the STEM field is to encourage curiosity and involvement in the space from a young age. Unfortunately, presently the majority of this encouragement is targeted towards boys. This is evidenced by a large number of STEM-related toys intended for boys and the exclusion of toys with stereotypical female styles. As such, we propose “The Programmable Action Figure”, a gender-neutral toy for children which encourages both boys and girls to get interested in the STEM field.

We hope that with the Programmable Action Figure, we will be able to encourage interest in STEM by coupling a popular toy type with a programmable interface to manipulate said toy. By exposing children early to the idea of programming, computer science, robotics, and STEM in general, we believe that this product can help alleviate the gender disparity that currently exists in the many STEM fields.

## Product Introduction

The Programmable Action Figure is a theorized device that allows the user to interact, play, and experience a personalizable motorized figure. The figure is paired with a programming interface with a simple, intuitive, user interface to allow the user to learn, engage, and develop an interest in robotics and computer science.

As a part of our development of this product, a prototype action figure was created (Details in Production Materials below) to demonstrate the intended function of the product. 

Furthermore, a robust framework for the programmable interface was developed using REACT to manipulate the actions of the figure if the user wishes. It currently supports actions that we ascribe as functions of a minimally viable product. The framework was constructed to be extremely portable and customizable and can be trivially expanded upon to add new functionality that may be added to the figure. A walkthrough of the programmable interface can be found [here](https://youtu.be/sbwzGIjk1e8?t=126). Code for the interface can be found [here](https://github.com/arbinb/FigureProgrammableInterface).
  
  
## 5 Week Milestones
**Week of 29th March: Initial planning and brainstorming.**  
This week, we met our goal by brainstorming and laying the groundwork for our project. We moved through a number of ideas but eventually landed on an easily programmable robot that could appeal to girls.  
  
  
**Week of 5th April: Start building 3D modeling parts.**  
During this week, we started modeling our ideas in a 3D environment. We also continued refining our ideas and our strategy for presentation through more brainstorming.

**Week of 12th April: Continue building/modeling parts and develop the the code lanaguge.**  
At the end of this week nad our meeting with Professor Kim, we had a much clearer idea of how to present our project in the final and what direction we wanted to take it in. Our prototype for a block based programming language was coming together nicely and we had a plan to execute in the coming weeks.  
  
  
**Week of 19th April: Testing the prototype and creating the video.**  
This week was mainly based around putting the final touches on the physical and software prototypes and creating the final presentation video. We created the video using a combination of live action video, screen recording, video scribe, google chrome extensions, and editing software and at the end it all came together for a presentation we were all happy with.

**Week of 26th April: Finalizing website, videos, photos, description of system processes and final presentation.**  
We presented our video on Monday and worked towards completing the website and the final wrapping up of the documentation for the project.

## Product Materials

The prototype action figure was made by purchasing a premade action figure that was composed of Polyethylene terephthalate (PETE). The action figure was then coated with white acrylic paint and quickly dried with hair dryers. The prototype was repainted and redried until all remaining surfaces were covered.

The programmable interface was developed using REACT. It was developed to offer a drag and drop programming experience like MIT’s Scratch. The development of the programmable interface was heavily aided by the following sources:

  
[FRESCO App Builder]https://github.com/successlab/fresco-appbuilder  
  
[React web audio graph]https://github.com/michalochman/react-web-audio-graph  
  
[React flow test]https://github.com/meatflavourdev/react-flow-test  
  
The FRESCO AppBuilder was developed by team member Arbin Bhuiyan as a part of his undergraduate research thesis in collaboration with Michael Chacko, and have given their blessing to allow their work to aid in the development of the programmable interface of the Programmable Action Figure. Jeremy Dombrowsk’s and Michał Ochman’s “React Web Audio Graph” and “React Flow Test” (respectively) allow for use of their work through a creative commons licence. 
  
  
## Product Future Work

The plans for the future primarily focus on improving the look and design of the figure. First step is to design and build a figure with various robotic parts. Parts such as programmable motors, moveable joints, and wiring for the system. With that achievement placing the robotic built figure into a shell of a woman or man. The women and man design will be very simplistic and focus on using gender-neutral colors on the figure and for branding. This means straying away from pink and blues and focusing on colors such as whites, greens, and yellows.

In addition to improving the figure and its functionality, the programmable interface would also have to be updated to reflect these new features. The primary focus would be to expand the movement operations the figure can do. Such as jumping, sitting down, or even the power to grab things. 

The next focus would be some frontend UI work to the programmable interface. Simple things like adding some color, fun animations, and a navbar with all commands to make the program more user-friendly user friendly for kids would be welcome additions that add to the functionality and useability of the entire figure/programmable interface combo.
