## 5 Week Milestone
**Week of 29th March: Initial planning and brainstorming.**  
This week, we met our goal by brainstorming and laying the groundwork for our project. We moved through a number of ideas but eventually landed on an easily programmable robot that could appeal to girls.  
  
  
**Week of 5th April: Start building 3D modeling parts.**  
During this week, we started modeling our ideas in a 3D environment. We also continued refining our ideas and our strategy for presentation through more brainstorming.  
  
  
**Week of 12th April: Continue building/modeling parts and develop the the code lanaguge.**  
At the end of this week nad our meeting with Professor Kim, we had a much clearer idea of how to present our project in the final and what direction we wanted to take it in. Our prototype for a block based programming language was coming together nicely and we had a plan to execute in the coming weeks.  
  
  
**Week of 19th April: Testing the prototype and creating the video.**  
This week was mainly based around putting the final touches on the physical and software prototypes and creating the final presentation video. We created the video using a combination of live action video, screen recording, video scribe, google chrome extensions, and editing software and at the end it all came together for a presentation we were all happy with.  
  
  
**Week of 26th April: Finalizing website, videos, photos, description of system processes and final presentation.**  
We presented our video on Monday and worked towards completing the website and the final wrapping up of the documentation for the project.
